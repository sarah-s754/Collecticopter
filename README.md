# Collecticopter
## Description:
*Collecticopter* is a C#-based, multi-level game in which the player flies around collecting items that randomly appear on screen, then uses them to ‘tame’ the creatures present in each level.

Collecting items either increases or decreases the player’s score depending on the type of item. Taming each creature requires the player to have a certain number of points, and the player must have a certain number of the item that the type of creature you are trying to ‘tame’ wants. The relevant items are taken out of the player’s inventory when the creature is ‘tamed’. If the player collides with the creatures before having enough points and the correct number of items of a type, the player will lose a life. When all three lives are lost, the game is over. Completing each level requires taming the creatures on that level. The difficulty of the three levels increases by having harder requirements for ‘taming’ the creatures, and having the creatures move at a faster speed.

Little ‘reaction’ images above the heads of the player and the creatures are used to indicate
when events take place, like points being gained from collisions with items, and player
losing a life or creature being tamed from collisions with the creature.

Enjoy! 🚁⛅
